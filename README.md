This is my Mini Project 
# Strong Number Checker (C Program)

##  Project Overview
This project is a simple C program created to check whether a given number is a **Strong Number** or not.

A **Strong Number** is a number whose sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to the number itself.  
For example:
145 → 1! + 4! + 5! = 145 ✔ (Strong Number)

This program takes a number as input and prints whether the number is **Strong** or **Not Strong**.

## Objective of the Project
The main goal of this project is to:
 Understand and implement loops in C  
 Learn the logic of factorial  
 Work with digits of a number  
 Practice logical + mathematical programming  

This project helps beginners strengthen concepts of:
 loops  
 conditional statements  
 modular arithmetic  
 factorial logic  

##  Technology Used
- Programming Language: **C**
- IDE / Compiler: Any C compiler .

##  How the Program Works
1️ User enters a number  
2️ Program separates each digit  
3️ Factorial of each digit is calculated  
4️ All factorial values are added  
5️ If sum equals original number → Strong Number  
6️ Otherwise → Not Strong  

##  Example
Input:
145

Process:
1! = 1  
4! = 24  
5! = 120  

Sum = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145  
Result → **Strong Number**

Input:
123  
Sum ≠ 123  
Result → **Not Strong**

- `README.md` → Project documentation file  

##  Why This Project Was Created
This project was created as a **learning exercise** to:

 improve programming logic  
 understand number theory concepts  
 work with loops and functions  
 build confidence in C language  

It is ideal for:
 Students  
 Beginners  
 Assignment / Lab programs  
 Coding practice  

## Future Scope
This project can be improved further by:

 Adding GUI interface  
 Taking multiple inputs  
 Displaying all Strong Numbers in a range  
 Converting to other languages (C++, Java, Python etc.)
 Creating a menu-driven math tool

##  Utility of the Project
This project helps in:

 Logical thinking  
 Competitive programming  
 Academic viva / exams  
 Fundamental coding concepts  
 Problem solving  

Teachers & interviewers often ask this question
